# Restaurant Search NER Recognition by Fine-Tuning DistilBERT

This project fine-tunes the **DistilBERT** model to perform **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for restaurant search scenarios.  
It is built using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- DistilBERT-based NER model
- Step-by-step training process in Jupyter Notebook
- Includes tokenizer and trained model weights
- Example predictions on custom input sentences

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- transformers
- datasets
- torch
- Jupyter Notebook

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch notebook
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Restaurant_Search_NER_Recognition_By_Fine_Tuning_DistilBERT.ipynb
```
2. Run all cells to train the model or load the pre-trained fine-tuned model.
3. Use the final model to predict entities in new sentences.
